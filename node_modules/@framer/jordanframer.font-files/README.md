## Overview

This package gives you the freedom to use custom font files in your Framer projects on the desktop & web.

I also fixes issues you may find when fonts don't display on the canvas or in preview and fixes devices that don’t natively have that font family.

Supported font file types: `.ttf` `.otf` `.woff` `.woff2` `.eot`

## Usage

#### 💾 Load Font Files

Watch this [project setup screencast video](http://jrdn.io/a3cf6b) on how to use this package with font files or by following the steps below: 

1. Add the **Loader Component** to the initial frame of your app.

2. Add the **File Component** to your Framer canvas and set these properties:
  * **CSS Name** the browser uses for your font
  * **Font File** to load in the prototype

3. Connect the **File Component** to the **Loader Component** Font Files list in the propety panel.

4. Preview your custom fonts in your app on mobile or desktop devices that typically don’t have your font using live preview or a share link.

If your font isn't showing up in your text layer typeface panel, watch this [custom typeface assignment screencast video](https://file.jrdn.io/L1ugkqXv) for additional guidance.


#### 🌐 Import CDN font CSS

Alternatively, if you have your font CSS on a CDN you can provide the **Loader Component** the URL in as the source as follows:

1. Add the **Loader Component** to the initial frame of your App.

2. In the properties panel of the component select **URL** for the source.

3. Paste in a URL to your font CSS CDN in the **URL** property.

4. Preview your custom fonts in your App on mobile or desktop devices that typically don’t have your font using live preview or a share link.


#### ⚙️ Code Component

To use this package inside your code component you must first to install this package, import the **Loader** and **File** components into your code component and use the imported components as follows: 

```
<Loader>
    <File cssName={FontFamily} filePath={fontPath} />
</Loader>
```

Make sure you store your font files in your project folder under `./design/assets/FontFiles/`so they are always available. If the `FontFiles` folder doesn't exist, make sure to create it.
